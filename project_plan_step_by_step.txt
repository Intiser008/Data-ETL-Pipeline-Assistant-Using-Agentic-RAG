Awesome—here’s a crisp, 
end-to-end build plan
 you can follow and show as incremental GitHub work. It covers data for the agent, full-stack build, cloud deploy, and CI/CD. I’ve broken it into 
milestones
 with small, demo-able steps and acceptance checks.
Build Plan — Agentic RAG Data ETL/Analytics Assistant
0) Repo + Project Scaffolding (Day 1–2)
Tech
: Python 3.11, FastAPI, Streamlit, LangGraph/LangChain, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, ChromaDB, Azure OpenAI (Chat Completions), Docker.
Repo layout

1) Data for the “AI agent” (No model training needed)
You won’t train the LLM; you’ll 
curate the retrieval corpus
 and 
few-shot exemplars
:
Demo DB
 (Postgres):
Start with 
Pagila/Chinook/Northwind
 or 
TPC-H (SF 0.01)
. Add 2–3 “business tables” (customers, orders, products) and 1–2 lookup tables.
Tabular files
 (for ETL):
A few 
CSV/Excel/Parquet
 datasets from public sources (Kaggle small sets, NYC taxi sample, retail sales samples).
Corpus for RAG
 (index in Chroma):
Data dictionary & table schemas (auto-extract from Postgres → markdown).
Business glossary (you write 30–60 entries).
Few-shot NL↔SQL
 examples (10–20, tied to your schema).
“How to” snippets for Pandas transforms (filter, groupby, join).
Optional
: if you want small “training”, fine-tune 
embeddings
 decision (but still use Azure text-embedding model; no LLM fine-tune required).

2) Milestone A — Minimal Query Assistant (Week 1)
Goal
: NL → SQL (read-only) → results table.
Work
Planner (simple classifier) → “query” path.
Retriever: build Chroma index from schema/glossary/examples.
Generator: prompt template (schema-aware, guardrails), call 
Azure Chat Completions
.
Executor: SQLAlchemy to Postgres (read-only user), enforce 
LIMIT
.
Return table + the generated SQL.
Acceptance
10 canned questions return correct results (exact match on rowcounts/columns).
No DML/DDL executed; blocked by regex/AST.

retriever-v1
,

.
3) Milestone B — Validator & Repair Loop (Week 2)
Goal
: Iterative “agentic” loop.
Work
Catch syntax/runtime errors; summarize trace; retry with short error-aware prompt.
Schema/rowcount checks (expected columns, non-empty).
Cap retries (N=2–3), timeouts, row caps.
Acceptance
90% of failing queries recover within 1–2 retries on your test suite.
All tool calls logged.
GitHub pushes

validator-loop
, 
error-summarizer
, 
retry-policy
, 
tool-logging
.
4) Milestone C — ETL (CSV/Excel/Parquet) (Week 3)
Goal
: ETL path with Pandas.
Work
New tool: 
pandas_runner
 for extract→transform (filter, groupby, join) → 
export
.
S3 integration:
s3://bucket/raw/
 for uploads
s3://bucket/reports/
, 
s3://bucket/charts/
 for outputs
Planner routes “etl” tasks; generator emits Pandas code (guardrails: safe ops only).
Acceptance
Given a CSV in S3, produce a grouped report CSV to 
reports/
 with correct aggregations.
Large file (>50MB) handled via chunked reads or skip with message.

etl-tool-v1
,

5) Milestone D — Visualizations & Reporting (Week 4)
Goal
: Tables + charts + downloadable CSV/Excel.
Work
Reporter module (matplotlib or Plotly).
Streamlit UI: show table, chart, and 
Download
 buttons (presigned S3 URLs).
Add short NL explanation of result.
Acceptance
For 5 analytics tasks, get chart+CSV and explanation that matches expected logic.
GitHub pushes

reporter-v1
, 
ui-results-view
, 
presigned-urls

6) Milestone E — UX polish & UAT harness (Week 5)
Goal
: Demo-ready app.
Work
UI flows: ask → show plan/SQL → results → save report.
“Citations”: show which schema/glossary snippets were retrieved.
Add session logs; simple admin page to view audit logs.
Acceptance
UAT script (10 tasks) executable end-to-end by non-technical user.
GitHub pushes

ui-polish
, 
citations-pane
, 
audit-view

7) Testing & Quality Gates (ongoing; formalize by Week 5)
Unit
: planner, validator, guardrails, exporters (pytest).
Contract
: API responses (pydantic models) with 
schemathesis
 or pytest.
Integration
: containerized Postgres + Chroma + minimal S3 (use 
moto
 or LocalStack for CI).
E2E
: Playwright/Selenium for Streamlit flows.
Datasets
: golden CSVs & SQL outputs for assertions.
GitHub pushes

tests-unit
, 
tests-integration
, 
e2e-tests
, 
coverage-ci

8) Security & Cost Controls (Week 2 then refine)
Read-only DB user; SQL AST/regex check to block DML/DDL.
Timeouts (LLM+DB); row caps/pagination.
Secrets: 
GitHub Actions secrets
 (dev) and 
AWS Secrets Manager
 (prod).
Costs: 
Chroma (local)
 > OpenSearch; 
RDS
 turned on only when needed; S3 lifecycle policy; small ECS task (Fargate spot optional).
Logging & metrics: CloudWatch (latency, error rate, retry count, LLM tokens).
GitHub pushes
: 
policy-guards
, 
secrets-wiring
, 
metrics-logging
.
9) Cloud Deployment (AWS + Azure OpenAI) (Week 4–5)
Minimal, credit-friendly topology
ECS Fargate
 service (one task) running your Docker image (FastAPI + Streamlit + Chroma).
RDS Postgres
 (db.t4g.micro) or start with 
SQLite
 for demos; scale to RDS for UAT week only.
S3
 bucket for 
raw/
, 
reports/
, 
charts/
.
ALB
 (or API Gateway + Fargate) in front.
Azure OpenAI
: keep external; store endpoint+key in Secrets Manager.
IaC (optional)
: Terraform in 
/infra/terraform
 (VPC, ECS service, ALB, RDS, S3, IAM, Secrets, CloudWatch).
GitHub pushes
: 
docker-image-ci
, 
aws-task-def
, 
deploy-scripts
, 
terraform-init
 (if using IaC).
10) CI/CD Pipeline (from Day 1; expand over time)
GitHub Actions
CI
 (on PR): lint (ruff/black), type-check (mypy), unit+integration tests, coverage gate, build Docker.
Security
: bandit, Trivy Docker scan.
CD
 (on 
main
 tag): push image to ECR → update ECS service; run DB migrations (if any); smoke test endpoint.
Workflow files
: 
.github/workflows/ci.yml
, 
cd.yml
.
GitHub pushes
: 
ci-basic
, 
ci-tests
,

,

11) Documentation & Demos (ongoing; finalize Week 5)
/docs
: architecture (use-case, sequence, 
C4 container
), API docs (FastAPI OpenAPI), runbooks (dev vs prod), example prompts, UAT checklist.
Record short GIFs: NL→SQL, ETL, chart export.
GitHub pushes
: 
docs-arch
, 
docs-uat
, 
demo-gifs
.
Stretch (if time permits)
Auth
 (Cognito or simple bearer tokens).
Dataset catalog
 (list available tables & files).
Query history
 & saved dashboards.
What to show supervisors (incremental evidence)
Every milestone ends with a 
demo PR
 and 
README update
.
Each PR links to: short Loom/GIF, tests passing badge, and checklists (“acceptance met?”).
Notes about “training” the AI
You 
do not
 need to train an LLM. Your “training” effort is 
corpus construction
: schema docs, glossary, examples, and Pandas/SQL templates that are 
retrieved
 to guide GPT-4.
If you later want a learning artifact: you can log (NL, context, SQL/Pandas, outcome) and use it to expand few-shots or fine-tune an 
embedding
 model selection—not GPT-4 itself.
This plan lines up with the structure and expectations you’ve already written in your interim report (sections 3.1–3.3 and deployment notes). 
If you want, I can turn this into a 
week-by-week calendar
 (from 
Sep 22 → Nov end
) with concrete dates/tickets you can paste into GitHub Projects.
