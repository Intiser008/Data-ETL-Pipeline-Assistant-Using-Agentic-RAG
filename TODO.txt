only keep necessary columns in the ETL csv files
convert those into parquets

From ChatGPT:
Clean / transform into your prices-style CSV

Columns you need: date, ticker, close_price, volume (you might include open, high, low optionally but your schema demands close + volume).

Rename columns (e.g. “Close” → close_price, “Date” → date).

Remove other unnecessary columns or keep them if you plan to extend your schema.
